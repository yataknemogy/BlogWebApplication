## Reporting a Vulnerability

At BlogWebApplication, we take security seriously. If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities within our project, please report them to us immediately so we can address them promptly.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Privately Disclose**: Please report the vulnerability to us privately by messaging us on Telegram at [@fso99](https://t.me/fso99). Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

2. **Provide Details**: In your report, please provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and any potential impact it may have.

3. **Be Patient**: We will respond to your report as quickly as possible and work to resolve the issue in a timely manner. We appreciate your patience and cooperation in helping us maintain the security of our project.

## Bug Bounty Program

At this time, we do not offer a bug bounty program. However, we greatly appreciate and acknowledge the efforts of security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

When reporting vulnerabilities, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Provide us with reasonable time to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.
- Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have confirmed that it has been addressed.

We are committed to working with security researchers to verify, address, and publicly acknowledge any valid vulnerabilities that are reported to us.

Thank you for helping us keep BlogWebApplication safe and secure for everyone.
